This is a sample text file for testing the word counter application. It contains various words, punctuation marks, and repeated terms.

The application should count all words, find unique words, and identify the most frequent word in the text.
Some words appear multiple times: the, and, is, are, should, word, words.

Here are some edge cases to test:
- Hyphenated-words should be counted as single words
- Contractions like "don't", "won't", "it's" should be handled properly
- Numbers like 123, 456.7, and mixed alpha-numeric terms like "word123" should work
- UPPERCASE, lowercase, and MiXeD cAsE words should be normalized

The word "the" appears frequently in English text and should likely be the most common word.
Testing, testing, 123. Testing again with some repeated words: testing, words, the, application.

End of sample text file. The final word count should include all these words properly processed.
